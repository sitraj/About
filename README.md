# Shounak Itraj: A Brief Introduction

Hello, I'm Shounak Itraj, a passionate information security enthusiast with an insatiable curiosity for all things related to keeping our digital world safe. Beyond the realms of cybersecurity, I find solace in the enchanting world of music, where I immerse myself in playing traditional Indian instruments. And in the quiet moments between, you'll often find me lost in the pages of a good book, for I am an ardent book lover.

Join me on this multifaceted journey as we explore the ever-evolving landscape of information security, savor the magic of music, and embark on literary adventures that expand the horizons of our imagination.
